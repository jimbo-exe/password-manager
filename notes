Missing stuff:
1. Multiple users - We need to add Global username and gpass to allow multiple users on the same software.
2. Most of the places where password has to be entered, the entry isn't censored.
3. Unlock Session - Enter Global Password only once and not have to reenter it. (To be added
    in settings tab and at signin)
4. Change gpass (in settings tab).
